# VPCivs_Compatibility
Some of my favourite LastSword civs and Tomatekh's Garamantes (original version) updated for VP with all the various functions that are now base to the DLL instead of LUA and so on.

Compatibility for the unique decisions mod
Compatibility for the 3/4 UC mod (need permissions)

Compatibility currently hardcoded (:P)
