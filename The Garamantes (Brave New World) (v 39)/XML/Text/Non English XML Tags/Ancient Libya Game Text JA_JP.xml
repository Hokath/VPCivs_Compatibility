			<Text>Aghrem is the Berber term for what is roughly known in Arabic as a Qasr. Strictly speaking, these terms may refer to an individual fort-like defensive structure or the entirety of a fortified town. Due to the limited nature of surviving Garamantian textual evidence, it is uncertain what the Garamantes themselves called their fortified cities. The Arabic Qasr is the term most often employed today when discussing Libyan architecture (both ancient and modern) in general. However, the Garamantian structure is perhaps best understood as a precursor building and not identical to the modern Qasr. It is also possible that Igherman, the plural of Aghrem, may be a linguistic cognate for the name Garamantes itself.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Garamantian cities were often structured around a central square Aghrem. These Igherman would have attached houses as well as collective granaries. However, it is not entirely correct to describe Igherman exclusively as fortified granaries, which is often the case in modern literature.  While granaries were included within an Aghrem, they formed just one part of a larger whole which also usually included religious and commercial structures. Igherman were often situated in mountain locations to aid in defense, as well as contained within a single, continuous wall.</Text>

			<Text>Although the extensive urbanization of the Garamantes is the primary focus of modern archeologists, the Garamantes existed as a nomadic people in the Fezzan area of modern Libya as early as 1000 BC. Even at the height of the civilization's power and urbanization a large portion of the population still existed as nomadic pastoralists. Additionally, Roman sources frequently describe raids conducted by nomadic Garamantian tribesman. The nomadic tradition is continued even today by the modern Tuareg descendants of the Garamantes who are the principle inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North Africa.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The plume existed as a sort of de facto symbol for the inhabitants of Libya in ancient sources, appearing in reference to a wide range of independent tribes and settled groups. The earliest mention of such is probably in regard to the Libu (from which the name 'Libya' is derived) and Meshwesh (potentially a cognate for the Berber self-identifier, 'Imazighen') who plagued and eventually conquered Egypt between her eighteenth and twenty-second dynasties. The Roman period saw the extension of this description to the Garamantes, and Garamantian nobility in particular were often depicted with a feather on top of their heads. Not just limited to Libya's mortal residents, both Egyptian and Roman sources often described Libyan deities with plumed head-dress.</Text>

			<Text>The Garamantes were a Saharan people who used an elaborate underground irrigation system and founded a prosperous Berber kingdom in the Fezzan area of modern day Libya. They were a local power in the Sahara between 500 BC and AD 500 and traded extensively, effectively controlling trans-Saharan trade with Roman-Carthage and Egypt and perhaps even the upper peoples of ancient West Africa.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVLOPEDIA_ANCIENT_LIBYA_MOD_TEXT_2">
			<Text>During the second millennium BC the Sahara's climate began to change from wet to dry and then toward its present extreme aridity. Humans adapted, in part by shifting from nomadic hunting to settled pastoralism and agriculture: In rock painting, imagery of the time shifts from big animal hunts to scenes of cow milking, goat herding and human grooming. But this shift was not without its trials. A Libyan invasion of the Nile Valley in 1200 BC, documented in the Egyptian record, may have been prompted by this climatic discontinuity.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At the turn of the millennium, the height of the Garamantian kingdom, the Sahara would have been recognizable as desert sands, but perhaps not as arid as it presents itself today. Ancient lakes and salt beds would have served as both a source of water and the commercially viable salt. Settlements would have remained primarily around oases and within wadis (dried riverbeds that would fill up and temporarily contain water after heavy rains).</Text>

			<Text>The Early Garamantian period is placed around 1000 BC. It is at this point that the Garamantes began to shift from primarily a pastoral nomadic people to one centered around irrigated agriculture and the establishment of permanent settlements. There is linguistic evidence to suggest a possible relation between these early Garamantes and the Meshwesh who plagued and eventually conquered Egypt around 1300 BC.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Garamantes would remain in relative isolation until the horse and camel had become domesticated, ca. 1500 and 200 BC respectively. The oldest capital of the Garamantes appears to have been Zinchecra, situated on a mountain spur south of the Wadi Al-Ajal. It was inhabited from 900 BC to the first century AD. The capital would later be moved to Garama.</Text>

			<Text>Herodotus informs us that the Garamantes were a very numerous tribe of people, who spread soil over salt to sow their seeds in, and hunted Ethiopian troglodytes (probably for slaves) from four-horse chariots. They were exceptional cattle breeders whose cows curiously ate backwards. Yet, Herodotus also describes the Garamantes as "Avoiding all intercourse with men, possessing no weapons of war, and not knowing how to defend themselves."</Text>

			<Text>Conflict with Rome</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVLOPEDIA_ANCIENT_LIBYA_MOD_TEXT_5">
			<Text>Rome, on the other hand, described the Garamantes as the epitome of barbarism using such epithets as numerous, savage, fierce, indomitable, outermost, panting, naked, miserable, tent- or hut-dwelling, scattered, promiscuous, lawless, receivers of booty, light-armed, given to brigandage, and black. They fought several wars against the Garamantes, sometimes crossing the desert to assault their heartland, and the enemy was subsequently demonized.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]According to the Roman poet Lucan, the first conflict took place when the Garamantes joined the Numidian king Juba I during the war between Julius Caesar and the Senate. Juba's army defeated the Roman commander Curio, but was in turn defeated by Caesar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Garamantes in Juba's army may have been a group of nomads, but the Romans now realized that the Garamantian threat could be serious, and in 19 BC their general Lucius Cornelius Balbus marched against the Phazanians and Garamantes. The war may have been very difficult, but on his return, Balbus could afford a splendid triumph; he also constructed a theater on the Field of Mars. It is possible that this attack on the Garamantian homeland caused great upheavals, which resulted in the abandoning of Zinchecra and the transfer of the royal residence to Garama.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Another conflict took place in 15 BC, when the governor of Cyrenaica, Publius Sulpicius Quirinius, attacked a group of Garamantes that had joined forces with the Marmarides, a tribe living east of the Garamantian heartland. The next campaign was AD 22, when Garamantes (probably nomads, perhaps the official army) joined Tacfarinas' war against Rome. In AD 69, Garamantes were in the army of the city of Oea, which attacked Lepcis Magna and potentially even conquered and held territory over the city for a while. It is possible that the execution of Garamantes taken captive during a punitive raid is shown on a mosaic in the Dar Buc Ammera villa.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]We are not informed about conflicts in the second century, but Rome still regarded the Garamantian threat as serious. In AD 203, three forts were built (Ghadames, Gheriat al-Garbia, Bu Njem), to keep the nomads away, and in AD 400, the Numidian rebel Gildo could recruit Garamantes. Again, we do not know whether they were nomads moving between Garama and the north, or soldiers of the official army.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It would be wrong, though, to conclude that the Garamantes and Romans were always at each other's throats. The Romans needed gold, salt, slaves, ivory, and exotic animals for their gladiatorial contests; the Garamantes needed metal, ceramics, olive oil, and other products. Usually, the relations were good, and the Bu Njem ostraca suggest that there was an understanding that runaway slaves from the Roman cities who reached Garama, were returned. The Garamantian warriors had become tradesmen, and it is indicative of the now friendly relations that the Romans believed the Garamantes to be descendants from no less a forefather than Apollo.</Text>

			<Text>The Garamantes constructed a network of underground tunnels and shafts, known as foggaras, to mine the fossil water from under the limestone layer under the desert sand. The underground foggara, built as early as the sixth century BC with bricked and cemented galleries and vertical cleaning shafts at regular intervals, are like those built in Egypt's Bahariyya Oasis in the 26th Dynasty and by the Romans centuries later in Tunisia and Algeria. Abandoned long ago, traces of the foggara are still visible everywhere in the wadi.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]These foggara required intensive labor for both construction and maintenance. Within one six kilometer stretch, some 60 individual systems have been counted. A staggering total of as much as 20,000 kilometers of south-north foggara may have existed within the wadi's 130 kilometer east-west length. Based on demographic models, the estimated 120,000 tombs imply that the stable population of the valley may have reached 10,000 people. Most likely, this system was maintained through slave labor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Botanical samples have shown that the inhabitants produced wheat, dates, olives, figs, grapes, and several other crops, which were irrigated by foggaras.</Text>

			<Text>Decline and Legacy</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVLOPEDIA_ANCIENT_LIBYA_MOD_TEXT_7">
			<Text>Historians place the end of the late Garamantian phase at around AD 500. Byzantine records claim the king of the Garamantes made peace with Byzantium and converted to Christianity around AD 569. Likewise, Arabic records claim to have imprisoned and dragged off the king of the Garamantes in chains around AD 668. The area would then be absorbed into the Islamic world.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Regardless, by that point in time, the Garamantian kingdom would have been but a shadow of its former self. Many of the foggaras had ceased to function and the population was shrinking to the smaller number that could be supported by well irrigation; much less efficient, since water had to be raised mechanically by muscle-power in buckets. What had gone wrong? The decline of the cities in Late Antiquity may have reduced the market for trans-Saharan traders. The Garamantian king's grip on power may have slipped and the supply of slaves to maintain the irrigation system run out.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Or perhaps the aquifers ran dry. Certainly they are dry now. It is estimated that over six centuries the Garamantes extracted 30 billion gallons of water (non-renewable 'fossil water') and the water-table must have gradually dropped until, perhaps, it fell below the level of the foggaras and left them as dry as the desert. And then the civilization of the Garamantes shriveled in the sun and disappeared beneath the sand.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, perhaps the Garamantes' greatest legacy to the outside world lay not in their agricultural achievements, but in their prowess for trans-Saharan travel. The measured routes, daily stages, mapped mountain passes, and rough bypasses around such no man's lands as the basaltic Haruj al-Aswad ("The Black Narrows") were used by centuries of later caravaneers, and many are still followed by today’s truck drivers. That in the Islamic period the Fezzan's capital shifted one wadi south from Garama to Murzuk meant simply that the north-south trade axis between Tripoli and Nigeria had gained in importance, and Garama had fallen off the main route.</Text>

			<Text>The Roman poet Marcus Annaeus Lucanus described the 'nudi Garamantes'; the naked inhabitants of North Africa who uselessly ploughed the desert sands. Such descriptions of the Garamantes in early Roman writing are typical, depicting a sort of primitive, impotent savage. According to Lucanus, the first conflict between Rome and the Garamantes took place when the Garamantes joined the Numidian King Juba I during the war between Julius Caesar and the Senate.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 81 BC Juba I's father, Hiempsal II, had been driven from his throne. Soon afterwards, Pompey was sent to Africa by Lucius Cornelius Sulla to reinstate Hiempsal as King of Numidia. As a result, both Hiempsal and later Juba Iwould became Pompey’s ally. This alliance was strengthened during a visit by Juba I to Rome where Juba I was insulted by Julius Caesar, and still further in 50 BC, when the tribune Gaius Scribonius Curio openly proposed that Numidia should be sold privately.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In August 49 BC, Julius Caesar sent Gaius Scribonius Curio to take Africa from the Republicans. Overconfident and holding the governor of Africa, Publius Attius Varus in low esteem, Curio took fewer legions than he had been given. In the Battle of the Bagradas River (49 BC), Curio led his army in a bold, uphill attack which swiftly routed Varus' army and in the process wounded Varus. Encouraged by this success, Curio acted on what proved to be faulty intelligence, and attacked what he believed to be a detachment of Juba's army. In fact, the bulk of the king's forces were there (including his Garamantian allies) and, after an initial success, Curio's forces were ambushed and virtually annihilated by Saburra (Juba's military commander). Curio was surrounded with the remnants of his troops on a hilltop and died in the fighting. Only a few were able to escape on their ships, and King Juba took several senators captive back to Numidia for display and execution.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With the arrival of Julius Caesar in Africa, Juba originally planned to join Publius Cornelius Scipio Salvito, but his kingdom was invaded from the west by Caesar's ally Bocchus II. He therefore left only 30 elephants behind and marched home to save his country.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Scipio knew he couldn't fight without more troops, and sent a desperate message to Juba for assistance. Juba immediately left the command of his kingdom's defence with Sabura, and joined Scipio with 3 legions, around 15,000 light infantry, 1,000 cavalry and 30 elephants for the Battle of Thapsus. However, he camped away from Scipio's main lines. Seeing the certain defeat of Scipio's army, Juba did not take part in the battle and fled with his 30,000 men. Having fled with the Roman general Petreius and finding their retreat cut off, they made a suicide pact and engaged in one on one combat. The idea was that one would meet an honourable death. Sources vary on the outcome, but most likely, Petreius killed Juba and then committed suicide with the assistance of a slave.</Text>

			<Text>The Garamantes in Juba's army may have been a group of nomads, but the Romans now realized that the Garamantian threat could be serious, and in 19 BC their general Lucius Cornelius Balbus marched against the Phazanians and Garamantes. Pliny the Elder records in his "Natural History", Balbus' punitive sacking of the Garamantian cities of Thelgae, Dedris, and even Garama. It is possible that this attack on the Garamantian homeland caused great upheavals, which resulted in the abandoning of Zinchecra and the transfer of the royal residence to Garama.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Another conflict took place in 15 BC, when the governor of Cyrenaica, Publius Sulpicius Quirinius, attacked a group of Garamantes that had joined forces with the Marmarides, a tribe living east of the Garamantian heartland.</Text>

			<Text>In 46 BC, Numidia officially became a Roman Province. After Juba I committed suicide as a result of his defeat at the hands of Julius Caesar, he was succeeded by his son; Juba II. Juba II was brought to Rome by Julius Caesar and as a result became thoroughly Romanized, receiving both a Roman education and military training. He was declared an ally of Rome and in 29 BC Augustus Caesar restored Juba II to his throne as King of Numidia and Mauretania.  Juba II would become one of the most loyal client kings that served Rome, marrying Cleopatra Selene II to cement his alliance.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At this point, it seems, Rome considered the Garamantes to be a subsidiary of Numidia with sources stating Juba II as King of Mauretania and the Garamantes. However, Rome never officially occupied the Garamantian heart-land for any extended period of time. It is uncertain how much political power Djalla maintained, although funerary records at Ahramat al-Hattia maintain a line of Kings of Garama separate from Juba II. Later sources also describe the Garamantes as allies and, occasionally, as a tributary of Rome.</Text>

			<Text>Trans-Saharan trade was essential to the strength and influence of the Garamantes during Djalla's reign. Pliny notes how "Garamantian Carbuncle" was especially prized by the Carthaginian and Roman elite. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that the black slaves present in Carthage were sold by Garamantian slavers. This correlates to Herodotus' earlier description of Garamantian charioteers hunting Ethiopian troglodytes. Here "Ethiopian" was most likely used as a generalized racial term, and the individuals actually sold most likely originated from the Tubu; upper West African inhabitants who bordered the southern edge of the Sahara.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was also toward the beginning of the camel period that caravan trade was being established. At this time, typical African products, such as the Guinean gold from Bambuk, began to regularly arrive at the Mediterranean coasts, and items of Punic origin then arrived in southern Morocco or Mauritania. The beginning of this trans-Saharan trade could only happen after the introduction of the camel into central and western Sahara.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The rock art of the central Sahara shows no discontinuity in the evolution from the horse period to the camel period, and the latter continued until the present. Therefore, the local introduction of the horse, the chariot, the throwing spear, the camel and writing can be attributed to the Garamantes and their nomadic precursors, who were already settled in the central Sahara, at least since the beginning of the first millennium BC.</Text>

			<Text>A qanat is a water management system used to provide a reliable supply of water for human settlements and irrigation in hot, arid and semi-arid climates. The value of a qanat is directly related to the quality, volume and regularity of the water flow. Much of the population of Iran and other arid countries in Asia and North Africa historically depended upon the water from qanats; the areas of population corresponded closely to the areas where qanats are possible. Although a qanat was expensive to construct, its long-term value to the community, and thereby to the group that invested in building and maintaining it, was substantial.</Text>

			<Text>An aquifer is an underground layer of water-bearing permeable rock or unconsolidated materials (gravel, sand, or silt) which acts as a reservoir for groundwater. Aquifers are filled with water from rain or melted snow that drains into the ground until it reaches a layers of less permeable rock. Wells drilled into aquifers provide water for drinking, agriculture, and industrial uses. However, aquifers can dry up if drained faster than they can naturally refill from precipitation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Fossil Water is groundwater that has remained sealed in an aquifer for a long period of time. Water can rest underground in aquifers for thousands or even millions of years. When changes in the surrounding geology seal the aquifer off from further replenishment, the water becomes trapped within and is known as fossil water. Fossil water is, by definition, a non-renewable resource. Whereas most aquifers are naturally replenished by infiltration of water from precipitation, fossil aquifers are those that get little or no recharge.</Text>

The extraction of water from such non-replenishing groundwater reserves (known as low safe-yield reserves) is known in hydrology as water mining.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System is among the most notable of fossil water reserves. Fossil aquifers also exist in the Sahara, the Kalahari, and the Ogallala underlying the US Great Plains. A further potential store of ancient water is Lake Vostok, a subglacial lake in Antarctica.</Text>
